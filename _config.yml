  Hi, this is Burak. I am a PhD candidate at Boston University, working under the supervision of Prof. Ayse Coskun 
  in [PeacLab](https://www.bu.edu/peaclab/) research group. 

  Broadly, I am interested in solving real-world problems using machine learning. My research focuses on designing and developing
  ML-based frameworks to optimize the performance of large-scale computing systems considering the explainability angle.

  But hey, I'm not just about the tech wizardry—I'm also on the prowl for the juiciest updates in the startup universe. My tech stack and some stuff that I have experience on:

  * Python, C++, Java (I am not a fan of Java)
  * Tensorflow, Pytorch
  * Dask, Scrapy
  * AWS (ECS, Lambda, Sagemaker, Step Functions, GraphQL, ECR)
  * Flask, Django, Docker
  * Learning Node.js, React, and Typescript - Only when I have time
