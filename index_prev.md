Hi, this is Burak. I am a PhD candidate at Boston University, working under the supervision of Prof. Ayse Coskun in [PeacLab](https://www.bu.edu/peaclab/) research group. 


Research
======

Interests: Applied Machine Learning | Explainable AI | NLP | Dialogue and Interactive Systems


### Scalable and Explainable Analytics for Large-Scale Production Data Centers 

+ Developing machine learning frameworks for production data centers systems to automate performance analytics and manage efficient resource utilization

+ Researching on semi-supervised and unsupervised ML frameworks that can work with a few labeled and a large number of unlabeled samples

+ Open-source: [AlbadRoss](https://github.com/peaclab/ALBADross), [Proctor](https://github.com/peaclab/Proctor), and [E2EWatch](https://github.com/peaclab/E2EWatch)


### Explainable Time Series Analytics

+ Researching and developing on model-agnostic, counterfactual-based explainability techniques for time series classification and forecasting models
+ Open-source: [CoMTE](https://github.com/peaclab/CoMTE)
